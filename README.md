# Fine Tunning YOLO v5

For my [chapGPT](https://github.com/isabelcabezasm/chapgpt) I needed to find one or more caps in the image that the user gives to the bot.
The typical/most famous algorithms of image/object detection don't recognize the caps, the classes like "bottle", "hand", "chair".. but not a bottle cap.

To achieve it I made my own version of YOLO v5. 

You can find my code here.
